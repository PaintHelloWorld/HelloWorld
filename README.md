### Hi, I'm Fangwei Liu (H₂O) 👋

I'm an **Applied Chemistry** freshman with a passion for turning ideas into code.

- 🔬 I’m exploring the intersection of **Chemistry and Computer Science**.
- 💻 My go-to tool is **Python** — because life is too short!
- 🎨 I also enjoy creative coding and building fun, sometimes silly, projects.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning everything I can and growing step by step.

#### My Digital Playground 🚧

This is where I share my coding experiments, from serious attempts to solve problems to playful side projects. Feel free to look around!

> “Don't mind my beginner's code — every expert was once a beginner. 😄”
